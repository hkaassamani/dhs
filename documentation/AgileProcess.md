#Our Agile Process

We executed this challenge with an agile approach, delivering working software every two hours, 
and building in an ability to respond to change. Our agile coach  was there to help guide our process and encourage whole-team collaboration.

As we executed, we followed a simple pattern:

Release Planning - Plan atleast 2 releases
Sprint Planning - Plan and execute two 2-hour sprints, using whole-team estimation and buy-in
Sprint Demonstration - Demo each Sprint's output, receiving feedback from the team and interested parties
Retrospective - Conduct a retrospective after each release, to adapt our work for the next release
